					"This political satire film follows the convention of Thai cinema during the Cold War, where every actor is dubbed by the voice that suits their roles. The hero sounds heroic and the villain sounds villainous. Ang, a transgender sex worker with a pretty, feminine voice is assigned a special mission as an undercover spy. She disguises herself as a cis-masculine man to enter into a romantic relationship with Jit, a belligerent yet idealistic student activist with an evil voice. Ang must extract important information from Jit. However, the mission goes awry as she slowly falls for him. Apolitical at first, Ang is slowly awakened by Jit to see the other world where people speak in another way."

					"Artist and political activist San Zaw Htway experienced the full force of military repression in Myanmar back in 1999, when he was sentenced to 36 years in prison for involvement in the re-establishment of the banned student union. Twelve years later, under a more lenient regime, he was released.",
					"In 2021, an aggressive military regime seized power again in a coup, brutally crushing mass protests. Friends, relatives, and other former political prisoners write letters to San, in whom they find comfort, understanding, and good advice. Despite everything, he never lost his spirit during his years of imprisonment.",
					"The remarkable and sometimes shocking images of the recent demonstrations against the regime are interspersed with home videos of San. The deftly edited footage and letter excerpts tell a tragic story of an extraordinary person and a country torn apart."
